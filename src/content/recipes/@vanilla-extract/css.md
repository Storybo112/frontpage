How to setup Vanilla Extract and Storybook

</RecipeHeader>

Vanilla Extract Uses TypeScript as your CSS preprocessor. Allowing you to write typeâ€‘safe, locally scoped classes, variables and themes, then generate static CSS files at build time. Storybook is an industry-standard tool for developing and testing UI components in isolation.

## Configure your Storybook builder

<div class="aside aside__no-top">

If you're already using Vanilla Extract in your project, you may already have these dependencies installed.

</div>

First of all, install the required dependencies:

```shell
# For Vite users
yarn add -D @vanilla-extract/vite-plugin

# For Webpack users
yarn add -D @vanilla-extract/webpack-plugin mini-css-extract-plugin
```

### Vite

For Vite users, Storybook uses your project's `vite.config.js` for its build configuration. This means if your project uses Vanilla Extract, it's also already configured for your Storybook. ðŸŽ‰

You can view a full example on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-cytqag?file=.storybook/main.ts).

### Webpack

For Webpack users, [@storybook/addon-styling-webpack](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-styling-webpack/) can get your Storybook up and running with Vanilla Extract in a few lines of code.

Run the following script to install and register the addon:

```shell
npx storybook@latest add @storybook/addon-styling-webpack
```

This will run a configuration script that will walk you through setting up the addon. If prompted, select `Vanilla Extract` as your CSS processor.

### Manually configure Webpack

For an example of manual configuration, you can view a full example on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sb-vanilla-extract-webpack?file=.storybook/main.ts).
